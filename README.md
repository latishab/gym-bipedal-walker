![BipedalWalker Episode 3200 - 306 Rewards](https://github.com/latishab/gym-bipedal-walker/blob/main/gifs/bw-video-episode-3200-306rew.gif?raw=True)

This project is done to understand how Reinforcement Learning (using PPO algorithm and its optimizations) works, as a final project of my AI course at uni.


Goal: To solve the normal version, you need to get 300 points in 1600 time steps. To solve the hardcore version, you need 300 points in 2000 time steps.


Results: I have solved our BipedalWalker-v3, with total max returns of 309 in 2,992,276 timesteps.
